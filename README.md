In my tech repository, i uploaded two files called "congig.yaml" and "myassignment1.py".
In config.yaml file, we have sample input file with a list of HTTP endpoints in yaml format.
In myassignment1.py file, we build a python code to check the health of the endpoints for every 15 Seconds and display the result as the availability percentage of the HTTP domains.
For this code, we used python3 version and also installed some libraries like requests, yaml, signal, time.
To run the code we have to use 'python3 myassignment1.py' command in the console/Terminal and the Log of the cumulative availability percentage for each domain is displayed to the console after the completion of each 15 second test cycle.
